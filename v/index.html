<h3>1.2.1.Reported Issues</h3>

         <td>
            <p><strong>&lsquo;Title on the Popups don&rsquo;t include spaces&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>Spaces were omitted from Popup Titles. For example, the &ldquo;Authorised Person&rdquo; popup title was &ldquo;AuthorisedPerson&rdquo;. These have been changed to include a space where appropriate.</p>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <p><strong>&lsquo;Number of filters before &ldquo;More Filters&rdquo; section varies&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>On some pages with a lot of filters, some of the filters are hidden by default and can be shown using the more filters button.&nbsp; The number of filters shown before the &ldquo;More Filters&rdquo; section is meant to be 10 but this varies from page to page.</p>
            <p>This has been fixed so there is always 10.</p>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <p><strong>&lsquo;The Tag ITR filters on Tagged Item Search pages is inconsistent with the rest of the application&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>The Tag ITR filters in the Tagged Item search page all state &ldquo;Tag ITR&rdquo; i.e &ldquo;Tag ITR Discipline&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tag ITR Signed Off Date&rdquo;</p>
            <p>These instead now only state the details of the search filter i.e. &ldquo;ITR Discipline&rdquo; or &ldquo;Signed Off Date&rdquo;</p>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <p><strong>&lsquo;Tag ITR &ndash; Completed and Incompleted are both in bold&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>On the Tagged Item search pages the Tag ITRs which are incomplete are meant to be in bold, to highlight outstanding scope. Instead both complete and incomplete Tag ITRs were highlighted as bold.</p>
            <p>This has been fixed to function as intended.</p>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <p><strong>&lsquo;Tagged Item Search Filters change order&rsquo;</strong></p>

         <td>
            <p>The order in which filters appeared was inconsistent between pages within the Tagged Item section.</p>
            <p>This has now been fixed.</p>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <p><strong>&lsquo;Some search filters are case sensitive&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>Some search filters were case-sensitive, meaning entering &ldquo;PX-234&rdquo; and &ldquo;Px-234&rdquo; in an affected filter would return different results.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This has now been fixed and all searches are now case-insensitive.</p>

         <td>
            <p>Due to a known issue, the bookmarks for MOC Parent Details were removed.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This issue has now been fixed and the Parent MOC Bookmarks are now available.</p>
         </td>

            <p><strong>&lsquo;Search Filters missing for Tag when searching via Tag ITRs&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>Several search filters were missing when searching by Tag and using the Tag ITR Search filters (for example the Primary and Secondary Handover filters).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This was due to a bug which has now been fixed, thus these search filters have been restored.</p>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            <p><strong>&lsquo;Punch List Item imported reported incorrect status&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>The Punch List Item import reported the wrong status for items where the Primary and Secondary Handovers field values were altered.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If the Primary Handover field was left blank the row would be classed as &ldquo;Unchanged&rdquo; even though inputting a Secondary Handover without a Primary Handover should be classed as &ldquo;Invalid&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>If the Secondary Handover field was left blank the row would be classed as &ldquo;Changed&rdquo; even though inputting a Primary Handover without a Secondary Handover should be classed as &ldquo;Invalid&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>Both scenarios now correctly display &ldquo;Invalid&rdquo;.</p>

         </td>
         <td>
            <p>The Edit Report List page allows you to change the ordering of the reports on the View page.&nbsp; Changing this order had no effect on the reports on the View page.</p>
            <p>This has been corrected, allowing the page to function as intended.</p>

            <p><strong>&lsquo;Interim Accepted Date panel not present on Level E Handovers&rsquo;</strong></p>
         </td>
         <td>
            <p>The Sign Off Panel for Interim Accepted Dates did not appear on the View Page for Level E Handovers.</p>
            <p>This has now been fixed.</p>

         </td>
         <td>
            <p>When the user&rsquo;s session expires due to timeout, the application automatically rechecks the user&rsquo;s credentials and (if successful) redirects the web browser to the last viewed page.</p>
            <p>If this happens when attempting to import nothing happens on the page and the user must manually refresh to continue using the application.</p>
            <p>This has been corrected to redirect as expected.</p>

         <td>
            <p>The Title Row on the Import Results omitted all spaces. For example, the &ldquo;Authorised Person&rdquo; title was &ldquo;AuthorisedPerson&rdquo;. These have been changed to include a space where appropriate.</p>

         <td>
            <p>If the user had Saved and Viewed a Level E Handover then changed Level Es, they would get a Not Found page instead of displaying the Level E handover for the new handover.</p>
            <p>This has now been fixed</p>

            <p>When uploading a Digital Document and the upload failed the reasons for failure where not listed on the page.</p>
            <p>This has been fixed so reasons are now listed.</p>

         </td>
         <td>
            <p>The MCDAC page had a slow response, a few methods have been attempted to speed this page up and it&rsquo;s now working quicker but is still sluggish.</p>
            <p>The Handover pages draw a lot of information from various sections and so run slower than most pages and although efforts will be taken to improve this, they will always be among the slowest pages in our application</p>

<p><strong>Full Details listed in each section under the User Restrictions part of the Field Listing</strong></p>
<p>When a user doesn&rsquo;t have permission to perform a certain action the button will now be hidden in hub2. I.e.
